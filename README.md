# Signature-Ready Legislation

**Legislation:**

1.  _noun_ laws, considered collectively.	

Turq.io is a funding network for citizen lawmakers.  Citizen lawmakers are everyday people that write signature-ready legislation for state and local legislatures.

Imagine the power behind presenting a congressional representative with a written bill to change a law instead of a wordy email or phone call as a ‘concerned citizen’. It shows the lawmaker that serious thought has gone into an issue and makes it easy to be presented to a chamber floor for a vote. It allows the ‘concerned citizen’ to become a ‘participating citizen’ and builds a healthier democracy. 

Signature-ready legislation has the following benefits:		

*  Helps lawmakers utilize their time more effectively for casework and lawmaking without having to draft legislative proposals.
* Shows legislators a cohesive plan to make, change, or strike down a law based on the needs of the people.	
*  Creates an easy path to have a law change considered and voted on by legislative bodies.	
*  Creates a starting point for debate or feedback from lawmakers and other stakeholders.	
*  Gets citizens involved and participating in democracy.	

You do not have to be a legislator or city council member to be able to draft legislation. You do not need to be a lawyer or have any special experience to write a bill. All that is required is the desire to see change happen and the willingness to do some research.	

This guide will take you through a general flow for writing legislation in the State of Massachusetts, but these steps can be followed in any jurisdiction. 	

 Remember this about your journey in learning to write legislation:

*  Be technical, but also be creative and have fun
*  Seek feedback, and accept it gracefully
*  There is no ‘one-size’ fits all method
*  Be open to a little bit of trial and error
