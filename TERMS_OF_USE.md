Creating an account on Turq is free. If you support an issue, we collect a 20% fee and our payment partners may collect fees. Our partners’ fees may vary slightly based on your location.

Some funds pledged by backers are collected by payment providers. Each payment provider is its own company, and Turq isn’t responsible for its performance.

You’re responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of Turq.

Limitation of Liability

Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Turq be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if Turq has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Turq is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Turq’s liability shall in no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months prior to the date of the initial claim made against Turq, or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.
Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold Turq, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Turq by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.
Violation of These Terms of Use

Turq may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Turq’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Turq’s customers. Turq reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Turq deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Turq also may disclose your information when Turq determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.

You acknowledge and agree that Turq may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Turq through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Turq determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Turq, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.

You agree that Turq may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Turq, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Turq obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Turq deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Turq may have at law or in equity.

You agree that Turq may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.

If Turq does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, Turq will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Turq. You agree that Turq will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.
Governing Law; Dispute Resolution

You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Turq and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.

Turq administers and operates the www.turq.io Site from its location in Summerville, Massachusetts USA; other Turq sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Turq reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area.

Miscellaneous

You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations.

If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Turq with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Turq with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Turq, Turq will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Turq’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Turq of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Turq and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.

Turq provides access to Turq international data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Turq products, programs and services that are not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Turq in your country intends to announce such products, programs or services.
