  **Background**


  A small Boston based financial coaching organization is sponsoring the Financial Literacy Model Legislation Challenge - to perform the due diligence of determining what changes will need to be made to the law in order to make high-quality financial literacy a permanent fixture in the curriculum of the school system in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.


  This competition is being used to:


  * stimulate and advance innovation in citizen drafted legislation;

  * analyze the current landscape of financial education in Massachusetts;

  * promote the development of robust financial preparedness for the young citizens of the Commonwealth;

  * and drive a passion for both personal finance in the youth and in citizen participation by the solvers proposing their versions of model legislation.


  Turq intends to incentivize all citizens to think creatively in developing solutions to financial literacy challenges and to share those innovations with the broader community.
