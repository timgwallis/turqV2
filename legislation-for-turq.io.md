That leads to this legislation upload form.

The body of your legislation will go under the first provisions heading. Follow the section number sequence that is the continuation or creation of the orignial legislation under this heading.

Special Exceptions and Other Provisions are optional.  You could include additional headingings such as jurisdiction or related laws in the Other Provisions field.  Whatever you deem necessary that is not included in the upload form should be included in the Other Provisions field.

The fields are otherwise pretty self explanatory.
